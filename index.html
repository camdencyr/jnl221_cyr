        <h1>Will There be a Record Low for NFL Concussions in 2024?</h1>

        <p class="dek">From 2015 to the end of last season, there was an average of 184 concussions per year. Through 12 weeks of the 2024 NFL season, there have been 70.</p>

        <p>Since his Alabama Crimson Tide debut in 2017, Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/dolphins/2024/09/30/tua-tagovailoa-injury-concussion-history-dolphins-qb/75376736007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suffered four concussions</a>, with three in his four-year National Football League career.</p>

        <p>His latest came in Week 2 of the 2024 season. </p>

        <p> But Tagovailoa is not the only player to deal with head injuries. From 2015-2023, there was an average of 184 concussions per season in the NFL, according to my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WdA2VihTJs9SVe-a537pGRcWQCfBNEvrIgvPxf8WLmw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new analysis of data</a> from the league. </p>

        <p>According to this data, through 12 weeks of the 2024 NFL season, there have been around 70 concussions that resulted in an injury status, hinting at a possible record breaking year.</p>

        <p> Comparing the numbers from 2015 and last season, there was a 20% decrease in concussions, according to my data. This number is on pace to be broken this year. </p>

        <p>Concussions are mild brain injuries that are caused by a hit to the head, which damages brain cells, changing how they use energy and communicate. </p>

        <p> <a href="https://www.upstate.edu/healthcare/providers/doctor.php?docID=wardc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Claudine Ward</a>, medical director of the concussion program at Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse, NY, said it is a case by case basis for how many concussions is too much for an individual, while also noting the severity of constant hits to the head.</p>

        <p>“Head trauma, repeated in and of itself, can put a person at risk for dementia,” Ward said.</p>

        <p>Although a concussion can occur on any play, kickoffs have historically caused the most head injuries. According to the <a href="https://operations.nfl.com/inside-football-ops/players-legends/player-health-safety/#:~:text=Data%20suggested%20that%20players%20had,wedge%2C%20while%20maintaining%20the%20play." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL</a>, kickoffs were around four times more likely to cause a concussion than a running or passing play. </p>

        <p> In an effort to reduce these numbers, the league introduced a new kickoff rule this year. </p>

        <p> Players on the kicking team now line up at the opposing team’s 40 yard line and are not allowed to move until the receiving team catches the ball. This allows for less momentum and downhill speed from players running towards the receiving team, thus limiting injury chances. </p>

        <p>Ward referenced the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0949328X24001728?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=8ef710172e0c901a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2022 Amsterdam guidlines</a>, a consensus statement that aimed at reducing contact that causes concussions and updated the return-to-play, or RTP, protocol. She said these influenced the new changes in the NFL.</p>

        <p>These recommendations aim to prevent premature return-to-play, which could lead to further injury. </p>


        <p><iframe title="Cornerbacks (CB) have suffered around 21% of all concussions " aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-wdywI" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wdywI/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="377" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}() </script></p>

        <p>The guidelines suggest that athletes begin light activity after 24 to 48 hours of initial rest if symptoms improve. Studies showed that it takes an average of 20 days for a player to return to the field and eight days for most players to return to learning. </p>

        <p>While following these guidelines, players suffered the fewest number of concussions in this year’s preseason since tracking began in 2015. Concussion causing plays dropped 32% and reached a similar probability rate to passing and rushing plays, according to the <a href="https://operations.nfl.com/updates/the-players/innovations-in-player-safety-help-drive-nfl-preseason-concussions-to-record-low/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL</a>. </p>

        <p> This is mainly due to the 20% decrease in players' speed on preseason kickoffs this year, according to the league. </p>

        <p>Ward addressed the misconception that after a certain number of concussions, a player should not be able to return to the field. She referenced the three concussion limits some high schools use. </p>

        <p> “Three is actually a pretty arbitrary number,” Ward said. “That number is not really based on science.” </p>

        <p> She referred to a <a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/2023/08/28/bu-cte-center-publishes-largest-cte-case-series-ever-in-youth-high-school-college-athletes-who-died-young/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boson University study</a>, which mostly examines athletes, that suggests repeated hits can put someone at risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. </p>

        <p> Many fans believed that Tagovailoa should have retired after his Week 2 injury. After four confirmed concussions, they noted the quarterback’s risk of CTE and dementia may be higher. </p>

        <p> Last year, Tagovailoa had a conversation with his family after suffering his third concussion, according to the <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/tua-tagovailoa-admits-he-considered-retirement-after-difficult-2022-season" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL</a>. He considered walking away from the game, but said his doctors told him that there was no evidence he was at a higher risk for a concussion or CTE, prompting his return to the field. </p>

        <p> Before Tagovailoa’s first game back in Week 8 this season, Dolphins Coach Mike McDaniel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV0u5ni__Ro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talked to the press</a> and said that the quarterback met with multiple medical experts, none of which advised that Tagovailoa should step away from the game. </p>

        <p> Tagovailoa never considered retirement this year, according to NFL insider Ian Rapoport. </p>

        <p> "He’s already begun seeing concussion specialists and will continue to do so, but there is no timeline to return," Rapoport wrote on <a href="https://x.com/RapSheet/status/1835312223889104932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1835312223889104932%7Ctwgr%5E0365c217495a1f1f95f86d55e7db5327b9ebc414%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fsports%2Fnfl%2Fdolphins%2F2024%2F09%2F15%2Ftua-tagovailoa-not-retiring-nfl-concussion%2F75236661007%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X</a> following Tagovailoa’s concussion diagnosis.

        <p> Ward said the Amsterdam guidelines attempt to get an athlete back into physical activity sooner than in previous years. As long as Tagovailoa showed progress, she believes he can play again. </p>

        <p> “I think if a person is appropriately cleared [following the guidelines], then I think it's certainly reasonable to go back within the season,” Ward said.</p>


        <p>In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHsom_p4BWo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">press conference</a> after his first game back, Tagovailoa discussed his path to recovery.</p>

        <p> “I’ve been preparing for five weeks as if I were to play…So it felt normal coming out there,” he said. </p>

        <p> Still, concussions remain a persistent challenge in football for all positions, raising questions about the balance between player safety and the sport's inherent risks. </p>
